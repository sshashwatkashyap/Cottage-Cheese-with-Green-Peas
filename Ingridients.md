Paneer – Well, I like to make paneer at home, as it is fresh and tastes amazing. But if you are short on time,       you can just buy off from your local dairy or the packaged one from the nearby grocery store. If using the store-bought one, you can put the paneer pieces in a bowl of warm water for 10 minutes, to make it a little soft.

Green Peas – Fresh Green Peas are available in abundance during Winters. But apart from winters, you can use the frozen ones in this Matar Paneer Curry. Just thaw the frozen peas before using them in the curry.

Oil – I prefer to use vegetable oil to make this curry, but you can also opt for mustard oil or even ghee.

Onion Tomato Paste – For this curry, we will make tomato onion paste, which is cooked nicely and forms the base of this curry. For this paste, we will need onions, fresh tomatoes, ginger, garlic, and green chilies. You can adjust the amount of green chilies according to your taste.

Spices – We will also need some basic spice powders such as coriander powder, turmeric powder, Kashmiri red chili powder, cumin powder, salt, and garam masala powder. Use Kashmiri red chili powder, as it adds a nice red color to the curry without making it too spicy.

Coriander Leaves – Finally, garnish this delicious and simple curry with some finely chopped coriander leaves.
